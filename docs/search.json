    "section": "",
    "text": "Hey guys! I’m Javier! I’m a National University of Singapore Year 3 Psychology student with a second Major in Communications and New Media. I took psychology because I wanted to help people in future, and I figured that the best way to help people is to learn more about people. I also believed that learning about communications is important with the ever-changing online environment of today; a lot of our classes, jobs and friendly interaction occurs over the Internet now.\nIn my free time, I love to play games and make music! I like to play gatcha games like Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail and Tower of Fantasy, but I also enjoy games of the roguelike genre such as Dead Cells and Slay the Spire. I am also a huge Mobile Legends addict (but am I good at it? that’s questionable).\nMusic wise, I am a piano player, bass player, and I also enjoy singing. I am proud to be a part of One Chamber Choir, and I look forward to seeing you guys at our concerts!"

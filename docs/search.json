    "text": "Hey guys! I’m Javier! I’m a National University of Singapore Year 3 Psychology student with a second Major in Communications and New Media. I took psychology because I wanted to help people in future, and I figured that the best way to help people is to learn more about people. I also believe that learning about communications is important with the ever-changing online environment of today; a lot of our classes, jobs and friendly interaction occurs over the Internet now.\nIn my free time, I love to play games and make music! I like to play gatcha games like Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail and Tower of Fantasy, but I also enjoy games of the roguelike genre such as Dead Cells and Slay the Spire. I am also a huge Mobile Legends addict (but am I good at it? that’s questionable).\nMusic wise, I am a piano player, bass player, and I also enjoy singing. I am proud to be a part of One Chamber Choir, and I look forward to seeing you guys at our concerts!"

In fact, Swift has a whopping $740 million net worth as of June 2023 (according to Forbes).\nWhat makes her music so popular? And how has her music changed and evolved over time? Analysing the statistics of Swift’s music will help other musicians to figure out the ingredients in her music to cook up hits just like her.

Shake if off, Shake it off!\nHow energetic is Taylor Swift’s music?\nSurely, everyone has bopped around to her hits at least once or twice before. But has her music become more danceable to, or has it become slower and more melancholic?\nTo find out, I plotted a graph of the following variables: Danceability, energy and tempo against the release dates of her music! This will allow us to see if Swift’s music has become more energetic or slower and more melancholic over the years.\nInsert graph of danceability, energy and tempo against release_date  \nHmm, but you may ask, what makes a song more danceable? Well, I did wonder too, so I decided to find out more about how danceability varied against energy, tempo, and loudness.\nInsert graph of danceability against energy, tempo, loudness  \n\nShe’s cheer captain (and I’m on the bleachers)\n\nDid you know, Taylor Swift has had less concert tours than her number of ex-boyfriends? That being said, she did hold many many performances throughout the world. Ever wondered if Taylor Swift had more acoustic or live tracks at any point in time? This graph will help us to see more.\nInsert graph of acousticness/liveness against track_release  \n\nGive me the keys\n\nLet’s find out what Taylor Swift’s favourite key signature is!\nInsert Graph of key_mode against track_name"
